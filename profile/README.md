# Vision for Robotics and Autonomous Systems (VRAS)

![Vision for Robotics and Autonomous Systems](/profile/vras.png)

We are interested in machine learning for robot perception. We research algorithms that map RGB, depth, Lidar, and thermal data onto robot behavior. We work with [outdoor tracked robots](http://robotics.fel.cvut.cz/cras/darpa-subt/), [humanoid robots](https://cyber.felk.cvut.cz/research/groups-teams/humanoids/#robots) and also collaborate with automotive â€“ autonomous cars.

We are always looking for strongly motivated Ph.D. students as well as undergraduate students. We often have an opening for post-doc positions. If you are interested in what we are doing and want to join us, send us your resume to [Tomas Svoboda](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~svoboda).

The group is also a part of Center for Machine Perception, [CMP](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/), and involved in Center for robotics and autonomous systems, [CRAS](http://robotics.felk.cvut.cz/). [Humanoid and cognitive robotics group](https://cyber.felk.cvut.cz/research/groups-teams/humanoids/) also belongs to us.

## ROS packages affiliated to VRAS

VRAS is not only a proud user of ROS 1 on all of its robots. We are also active community members, contributing to both ROS 1 core and developing lots of our own ROS 1 packages. Most of them are published under this github organization.

Apart from those, VRAS also develops the following ROS 1 packages established at different locations: [robot_body_filter](https://github.com/peci1/robot_body_filter), [tf_remapper_cpp](https://github.com/tradr-project/tf_remapper_cpp), [tf2_server](https://github.com/peci1/tf2_server), [static_transform_mux](https://github.com/tradr-project/static_transform_mux), [dynamic_robot_state_publisher](https://github.com/peci1/dynamic_robot_state_publisher), [tensorflow_ros_cpp](https://github.com/tradr-project/tensorflow_ros_cpp), [point_cloud_transport](https://github.com/paplhjak/point_cloud_transport), [nav_utils](https://github.com/tpet/nav_utils), [rosbash_params](https://github.com/peci1/rosbash_params), [movie_publisher](https://github.com/peci1/movie_publisher).
