# Vision for Robotics and Autonomous Systems (VRAS)

![Vision for Robotics and Autonomous Systems](/profile/vras.png)

We are interested in machine learning for robot perception. We research algorithms that map RGB, depth, Lidar, and thermal data onto robot behavior. We work with [outdoor tracked robots](http://robotics.fel.cvut.cz/cras/darpa-subt/), [humanoid robots](https://cyber.felk.cvut.cz/research/groups-teams/humanoids/#robots) and also collaborate with automotive â€“ autonomous cars.

We are always looking for strongly motivated Ph.D. students as well as undergraduate students. We often have an opening for post-doc positions. If you are interested in what we are doing and want to join us, send us your resume to [Tomas Svoboda](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~svoboda).

The group is also a part of Center for Machine Perception, [CMP](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/), and involved in Center for robotics and autonomous systems, [CRAS](http://robotics.felk.cvut.cz/). [Humanoid and cognitive robotics group](https://cyber.felk.cvut.cz/research/groups-teams/humanoids/) also belongs to us.
